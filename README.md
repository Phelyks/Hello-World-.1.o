This are the steps I used to create this website. Created a Git Repo, hosted it on Git Pages. Created a README.md file. Then cloned it locally.

Created index.html file then the asset folders. This site has mainly used HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript function at the tail end.

The live link hosted at GitHub is as follows:
